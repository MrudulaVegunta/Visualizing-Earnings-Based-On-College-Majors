# Visualizing-Earnings-Based-On-College-Majors

In this mini project we will be exploring our data and invest time in finding the patterns in the data quickly by creating visualizations.

The dataset we'll be working with is based on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.

Each row in the dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more.
